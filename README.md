Client/Server Development

*How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I try to follow standard practices when typing out code and use proper syntax. I also try to also comment on the code tto increase its readabilty. This makes finding what section of code controls a function easier. The CRUD module could be reused for almost any mongodb application which makes it extremly useful. 

*How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist I ask what is the problem I am trying to solve. With the dashboard requirements I had the problem of returning the information required in the format requested. I used the CRUD module already developed to return the information that was needed. Since I had never worked with mongodb, I had to learn a whole new skill set, but my stradigy was to compartmentalize each section of the project. 

*What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

As a computer scientist I work with data and its algorithms. I think this is important because my job is not just to code a program, but to study it an optimize it.
So yes I believe I would work on a project like this to analaze the code they are using and to find a better method to perform the same funtion in a optimzed method.
